## customTypes/

The **src/customTypes** folder holds two files:
- The ***src/customTypes/customTypes.ts*** defines the data types created specifically for the app. This file was added added to the .gitignore file to avoid it being committed to the repository until deployment, when it will be removed from it and pushed to the repository.
- The ***src/customTypes/errors.ts*** file defines the custom error types used by the app; basically a 403: Forbidden and a 502: Bad Gateway errors.
